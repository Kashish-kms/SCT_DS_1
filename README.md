# Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis  
### Data Science Internship at Skillcraft Technologies

## 📌 Project Overview

Welcome to my submission for **Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
In this task, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the provided dataset, with a focus on visualizing the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using appropriate charts.

The main objective was to understand data patterns and present insights through visualizations such as bar charts, stacked charts, and histograms.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, the following steps were carried out:

### ✔ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values  
- Identified duplicate records  
- Detected outliers  
- Applied necessary cleaning techniques  

### ✔ Visualization
- Created bar charts and stacked charts  
- Visualized distributions of categorical and continuous variables  
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate meaningful plots  

These visualizations help in understanding trends and distributions within the dataset.
